# Generate CTL

'''
% Please generate a ${description} following the requirements provided below:

% ${ requirements: [A, B, ...] }

% For each requirement, translate it into a CTL (Computation Tree Logic) formula.
% Start by assigning a unique symbol to each activity or action, and then
% represent the requirements using CTL formulas.

% The output should be structured as follows:

% { 
%     symbols: [(initiator, symbol, activity)],
%     formulas:[CTL_formula_1, CTL_formula_2, ...]
% }

% Make sure each CTL formula accurately captures the corresponding requirement.
